# Developer’s Guide

## Repositories

The SIMONA repository on github [is here](https://github.com/ie3-institute/simona).

The convention for merging into the developer branch is that it needs to pass all tests and at least two other active SIMONA developers need to review your changes before merging. Please do this by creating a pull request from any new feature branches into dev. We also encourage you to create pull requests early in your development cycle which gives others an opportunity to observe and/or provide feedback in real time. When you are ready for a review, invite one or more through the pull request.

Please use the following naming convention for feature branches, “&lt;initials-or-username&lt;/#&lt;issue-number&lt;-&lt;descriptive-feature-branch-name&lt;”. E.g.: ab/#issue123-update-docs
