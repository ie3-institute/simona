  abstract="The volatile feed-in of distributed generation based on renewable energy sources as well as new and intelligent loads and storages require an appropriate consideration in the distribution grid planning process. With the conventional planning method being dependent on extreme scenarios, the consideration is very limited. Therefore, a new planning tool based on the concept of a multi-agent system is presented. In this system, every network user is represented by an agent, allowing not only the consideration of the volatile feed-in characteristics of renewable energy sources but also of the dependencies between the network users and their environment. Every network user is modeled as an agent of its own, guaranteeing the preservation of its individual character. Within this chapter, a system overview is given and the agent design process demonstrated on the example of the household load agent and the storage agent, including negotiations. This multi-agent system generates time series for all relevant system variables, defining detailed input parameters in the distribution grid planning process. The probabilities of occurrence of loading situations can be derived from the time series. For the first time, this allows for a detailed determination of the conditions in the up to now rarely measured medium and low voltage grids. As a consequence, new assumptions for the planning process are derivable, permitting a demand- and future-oriented grid planning and avoiding over-dimensioning of the grids.",
