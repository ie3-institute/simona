# Thermal Grid Model

The Thermal Grid Model introduces a coupling point to thermal system, equivalent to an electrical node. It can be used to interconnect thermal units to a thermal heat network.

A Thermal Grid Model consists of a [thermal house](thermal_house_model) and / or a [cylindrical thermal storage](cts_model) which are supplied by a thermal source like a [heat pump](hp_model).

## Attributes, Units and Remarks
