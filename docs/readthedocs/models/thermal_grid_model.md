# Thermal Grid Model

The Thermal Grid Model introduces a coupling point to thermal system, equivalent to an electrical node. It can be used to interconnect thermal units to a thermal heat network.

A Thermal Grid Model consists of a {ref}`thermal_house_model` and / or a {ref}`cts_model` which are supplied by a thermal source like a [Heat pump].

## Attributes, Units and Remarks

Please refer to {doc}`PowerSystemDataModel - Thermal Bus <psdm:models/input/thermal/thermalbus>` for Attributes and Units used in this Model.
