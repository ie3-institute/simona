### Triggering of participant agents


#### Participant triggered by primary data

This activation protocol is used, if the agent receives and is required to playback externally given, precalculated model
results.

#### Participant triggered by secondary data

This is the usual activation protocol of a participant agent.
The participant agent asks the scheduler to trigger it (the participant agent) in the same tick in order to achieve
timely synchronization within the ready check window.

#### Participant triggered by itself

This case only occurs, when the participant model itself does not rely on any other data.
This might be the case for a fixed feed in model as well as constant power load models.
