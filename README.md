# SIMONA
The agent-based simulation environment SIMONA provides a simulation toolbox to run and implement large-scale agent-based
electricity grid simulations with focus on distribution grids. As a result, close-to-reality time series are
generated from various system participants and grid assets that can be used to analyze a given power grid.
Application cases are for example distribution grid planning purposes but also flexibility analysis or coupled
sector interdependency analysis. The framework contains several out-of-the-box available models for a wide variety of grid participants as well as their
operational behavior.

More information are provided in the project's [documentation](http://simona.readthedocs.io/).

## Usage and Contribution
SIMONA is part of several ongoing research projects and will be part of future research projects. Hence, the codebase
is continuously under development from different perspectives, needs and developers.

We invite everyone to use SIMONA for their own research or for usage in a research project. If you use SIMONA for your
own projects or research, please provide a reference to this repository. Furthermore, if you publish your scientific work
please give appropriate credit by citing one of the introduction papers of SIMONA. 

We're also happy for any feedback and contributions. For details on how to contribute, please take a look at the
CONTRIBUTING.md file in the root directory of this repository.
