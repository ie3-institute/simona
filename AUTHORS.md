# Authors
The following files lists all authors that have been involved in the development of SIMONA either based due their
involvement in related research projects, as research assistants or by making voluntarily contributions.
All authors ordered alphabetically.

## SIMONA 1.0
SIMONA 1.0 has been the first implementation of the agent-based approach developed as part of the research
project _Agent.Netz_ and the PhD theses of Jan Kays and André Seack. Afterwards, SIMONA 1.0 has been used
for investigations in the subsequent research projects _Agent.GridPlan_ and _DesigNetz_. This version of SIMONA
has been implemented in Java using the JADE framework. It has not been made publicly available and is not further maintained.

## SIMONA 2.0
Based on the experiences in the research projects _Agent.GridPlan_ and _DesigNetz_ the code has been fully
re-implemented and the main concept of SIMONA 1.0 has been revised. While the fundamental idea of an agent-based
power system simulation has been taken from the first implementation, the simulation capabilities have been extended broadly.
This version of SIMONA is the version that has been made publicly available as open source code in 2021. It is implemented in 
Scala and uses pekko as its main library for concurrent calculation and to represent agents.
