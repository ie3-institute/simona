/** A scheduler core that activates actors in phases when active. This means
  * that only one actor at any given time is activated and the completion of
  * said actor is necessary before activating other actors scheduled for the
  * same tick.
  *
  * When multiple actors are scheduled for the same tick, they are always
  * activated in the same order, which is given by the initial scheduling of
  * said actors. Thus, if e.g. actor 1 has been scheduled for initialization
  * before actor 2, actor 1 will be activated before actor 2 for the
  * initialization tick and all consecutive ticks.
